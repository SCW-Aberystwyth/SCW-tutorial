# Introduction to Super Computing Wales

## This version of the notes is no longer being updated and has been superseded by the version at (https://supercomputingwales.github.io/SCW-tutorial/). It has been left here only for reference by those who might have bookmarked this page.

This lesson introduces using the Super Computing Wales HPC system. 

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Some basic experience of the Unix command line is expected. The material covered in the Software Carpentry Introduction to Unix Shell (http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) is more than enough to cover this.
